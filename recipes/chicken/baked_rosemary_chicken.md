## Preparation Timeline

### Step 1: Thaw and Prep Chicken
- **Handwashing Reminder:** "Alright, everyone! Before we dive into the culinary fun, let’s get those hands squeaky clean. Soap and water, folks—no shortcuts!"
  
- **Thaw the Chicken:** Place the frozen chicken breasts in a large bowl filled with cold water. Change the water every 30 minutes until thawed (approximately 1-2 hours).
  - **Toddler Tip:** "Let your little one help by holding the bowl while you change the water. Make sure the water isn’t too cold for their little hands. And remember—after handling the chicken or water, it’s back to handwashing!"

- **Season the Chicken:** Once thawed, mix 1/2 teaspoon pepper and 1 teaspoon rosemary. Rub this mixture over the chicken breasts.
  - **Toddler Tip:** "Let your toddler sprinkle the seasoning on the chicken. Keep a close eye to avoid any cross-contamination, and wash hands right after. Teamwork makes the dream work, but safety first!"

### Step 2: Prepare Rice

#### Detailed Rice Washing Steps
1. **Measure Rice**: Measure 1 cup of dry rice and place it into a large bowl.
2. **Fill with Water**: Fill the bowl with cold water, enough to cover the rice by about 2 inches.
3. **Stir the Rice**: Use your hand to gently stir the rice in the water. The water will turn cloudy as the excess starch is released.
4. **Drain the Water**: Carefully pour the water out of the bowl, using a fine-mesh sieve or colander to catch any rice that may escape. Hold the rice back with your hand while draining.
5. **Repeat**: Refill the bowl with fresh cold water and repeat the process 2-3 times, until the water runs mostly clear. This ensures that the excess starch is removed, preventing the rice from becoming too sticky.
6. **Final Drain**: After the last rinse, pour the rice into the fine-mesh sieve or colander and let it drain completely.

- **Add to Rice Cooker:** Once the rice is washed and drained, place it into the rice cooker. Add 2 cups of chicken broth.
  - **Toddler Tip:** "This is a great moment for your toddler to help pour the chicken broth into the rice cooker. Give them the reigns while you supervise—they’ll love it!"

### Step 3: Start Cooking Chicken
- **Preheat Oven:** Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
- **Grease the Baking Dish:** Lightly spray the bottom and sides of the baking dish with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) to prevent sticking.
  - **Toddler Tip:** "Let your toddler help with the spraying. Make sure they hold the can steady and spray evenly. Precision spraying—just like in science!"

- **Cover Chicken:** Place the seasoned chicken in the greased baking dish and cover it with foil.
- **Bake Chicken:** Put the chicken in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes.

### Step 4: Start Cooking Rice
- **Cook Rice:** 
  - **Option 1 (Automatic Rice Cooker):** If your rice cooker starts cooking as soon as it is plugged in, go ahead and plug it in now. The cooker will automatically switch to "warm" when the rice is done.
  - **Option 2 (Rice Cooker with a Switch):** If your rice cooker has a "cook" switch, plug it in, then press the switch to start cooking. It will switch to "warm" automatically when the rice is done.
  - **Toddler Tip:** "Your toddler can help by either plugging in the rice cooker or pressing the switch. It’s button-pressing fun with a side of rice!"

### Step 5: Make the Sauce
- **Melt Butter:** In a small saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.
  - **Toddler Tip:** "If your child is ready, they can help place the butter in the saucepan and gently move it around with a fork to help it melt. Keep them safe and supervise closely—this is where the real culinary magic happens."

- **Make Roux:** Stir in 2 tablespoons of flour, cooking for 1-2 minutes.
- **Add Liquids:** Slowly whisk in 1 cup of turkey gravy and 1 cup of chicken broth. Add 1 teaspoon rosemary and turmeric if using.
- **Thicken Sauce:** Cook until thickened, about 5-7 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning.

### Step 6: Prepare Broccoli
- **Microwave Broccoli:** Cook the Green Giant Sauced Broccoli in the microwave as per the package instructions (usually 5-6 minutes).
  - **Toddler Tip:** "Let your toddler press the buttons on the microwave under your supervision. It’s like launching a culinary rocket!"

## Handwashing Reminders
- **After Thawing Chicken:** Wash your hands after handling the chicken or the water used to thaw it.
- **After Seasoning Chicken:** Wash your hands again after seasoning the chicken.
- **After Helping with Raw Ingredients:** Make sure your toddler washes their hands after handling any raw ingredients or after touching their face during cooking. Safety first, fun second—okay, maybe they’re tied for first.

## Debugging & Troubleshooting

1. **Rice Boiling Over**:
   - **Problem:** Rice starts boiling over in the rice cooker.
   - **Solution:** Briefly lift the lid to release steam and gently stir the rice. If it persists, turn down the heat (if possible). It's like defusing a tiny rice bomb—precision is key!

2. **Rice Cooker Still on "Cook"**:
   - **Problem:** The rice cooker hasn’t switched to "warm" and the rice isn’t fully cooked.
   - **Solution:** Stir the rice again. If it’s still too wet, let it continue cooking. If you have an automatic rice cooker that doesn’t allow manual switches, wait until it switches to "warm," then check the rice and let it sit if needed. Patience, young grasshopper.

3. **Chicken Cooking Too Fast/Slow**:
   - **Problem:** Chicken is either done too early or not reaching 165°F by the expected time.
   - **Solution:** Check with a meat thermometer. If done early, cover with foil and keep warm. If it’s cooking too slow, extend the baking time in 5-minute increments. It’s all about getting that perfect, juicy bite.

4. **Sauce Cooling Down**:
   - **Problem:** The sauce has thickened and cooled while waiting for other components.
   - **Solution:** Reheat on low, stirring occasionally before serving. Think of it as a delicate potion that just needs a little warming up to regain its magical properties.

## Final Steps

### Step 7: Final Plating
- **Fluff Rice:** Fluff the rice with a fork once the cooker switches to "warm."
- **Slice Chicken:** Slice the chicken for serving if it hasn’t been done already.
- **Plate the Meal:** Place the rice on plates, top with sliced chicken, drizzle with that creamy sauce, and serve with microwaved broccoli on the side. Presentation is everything, even when it’s destined to be devoured.

### Step 8: Serve Dinner
- **Enjoy your meal!** Everything should be warm, delicious, and ready to enjoy with minimal cleanup.
  - **Toddler Tip:** Let your toddler help by setting the table. It’s like preparing a mini feast—everyone’s got a role to play.

## Multiple Kids: Alternative Suggestions
- **Divide and Conquer:** If you have multiple little chefs, give each one a specific task. One can be in charge of seasoning the chicken, another can help with washing the rice, and the third can press the microwave buttons. Keep them engaged by rotating roles next time!
  - **Alternative Toddler Tip:** For younger toddlers or those who prefer simpler tasks, have them assist with setting the table or handing you ingredients. They’ll still feel involved and proud of their contribution.
