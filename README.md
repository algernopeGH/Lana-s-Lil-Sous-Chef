# Lana's Lil' Sous Chef

"Alright, listen up, future kitchen wizards! I created this repository out of pure necessity... and maybe a little bit of a desire to impress Lana. But mostly necessity. You see, Lana's always on the go, saving the world one sarcastic quip at a time. And she’s got this amazing kid who deserves more quality time with their mom. So, I put together this collection of easy, fun, and delicious recipes that they can tackle together. Consider this my magnum opus of culinary science for the busy, the brave, and the slightly insane.

This isn’t just a cookbook—it’s a journey. A journey into the art and science of cooking with a kid who thinks sprinkling salt is the pinnacle of sophistication. So, buckle up, because we’re diving into the basics, like how to cook rice, all the way to more advanced culinary concoctions that even Archer would be proud of (if he ever ate anything that wasn’t drowned in bourbon)."
